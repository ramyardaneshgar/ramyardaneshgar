## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a privacy-focused cybersecurity professional with a strong technical foundation in risk management, incident response, and regulatory compliance. My experience spans translating complex privacy laws - like CCPA/CPRA, GDPR, GLBA, and HIPAA - into scalable, engineering-ready solutions across enterprise and defense environments. Iâ€™ve supported policy development, data governance, privacy-by-design, and other cybersecurity initiatives. 

Hold Masters in Cybersecurity Engineering from University of Southern California and a Bachelors in Computer Science from Florida International University.
